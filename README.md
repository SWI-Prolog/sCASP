# SWI-Prolog port (swipl branch)

> This is a fork from https://gitlab.software.imdea.org/ciao-lang/sCASP.
> It provides a port of s(CASP) to SWI-Prolog.

## About the SWI-Prolog port

The SWI-Prolog port is fully functional and from the solver prespective
fully compatible with the Ciao original. The SWI-Prolog port provides
two significant optimizations: (1) a more low level implementation for
the term copying required for _forall_ constructs that result from
_dual_ rules for clauses that introduce variables in the body as well as
for _global constraint_ and (2) an index to speedup finding loops and
already proved literals. This often leads to about 10 times better
performance.

Running requires __SWI-Prolog 8.5.6 or later__. The `scasp` executable
can be build on POSIX systems by running `make` in the toplevel of the
sCASP directory. On Windows

  - Add the `bin` directory of SWI-Prolog to `%PATH%`, so you can run
    `swipl.exe` and the swipl DLLs can be found.
  - run this to create `scasp.exe`

	swipl.exe --no-pce --undefined=error -O -o scasp -c prolog/scasp/main.pl

The command line arguments are similar, but with small differences due
to the use of SWI-Prolog's commandline parser.  Run `scasp -h` for details.
The output is different, using Unicode and, if possible, color to simplify
reading the model and justification.

The  pack  also  provides  `scasp`   as  a  SWI-Prolog  _app_.   After
installing the pack, `scasp` can be executed as below, i.e., replacing
`scasp` with `swipl scasp`.

    swipl scasp [option ...] file ...

Using `scasp` as  an _app_ is more  portable, but as the  app needs to
load  sCASP  at  runtime,  it  starts  considerably  slower  than  the
executable generated above.


## Using s(CASP) as a Prolog library

Next to using the s(CASP) executable, s(CASP)  can be used as a library.
For this, activate the  sCASP  directory  as   a  SWI-Prolog  add  on by
starting SWI-Prolog in the top directory and run

    ?- pack_install(.).

Now you can load scasp using

    :- use_module(library(scasp)).

Running s(CASP) queries take a normal Prolog program that can be made
available in the usual way: by consulting a file, asserting, etc. The
program must respect the sCASP restrictions. Using any built-in or
control structure that is not known to s(CASP) results in an error.

From the toplevel REPL loop, s(CASP) queries are executed by prefixing
them with one of the 7 operators below.

  | Op   | Description                                   |
  |------|-----------------------------------------------|
  | ?--  | Prove and only show the bindings              |
  | ?+-  | Prove, show bindings and model                |
  | ?-+  | Prove, show bindings and justification (tree) |
  | ?++  | Prove, show bindings model and justification) |
  | ??+- | As above, but using _human_ language output   |
  | ??-+ |						 |
  | ??++ |						 |

? and ?? are backward compatible aliases   for ?+- and ?++. For example,
this shows the model.

    ?- ? p(X).

The predicate scasp/2 can be used to get access to the model and tree to
reason about them. For example, this  returns   the  model  as a list of
terms and the justification as a tree structure.

    ?- scasp(goal(X), [model(M), tree(T)]).


SWI-Prolog  s(CASP)  can  also   be   used    in   your   browser  using
[SWISH](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/example/scasp.swinb).

Finally, there is a simple [web
server](https://dev.swi-prolog.org/scasp/). This server can also be
deployed locally using the command below. Add `-h` for options.

    swipl examples/dyncall/http.pl

The web server lets you post s(CASP) programs and get their results as
HTML or JSON. See [Help](https://dev.swi-prolog.org/scasp/help) for
details.

### Calling Prolog from s(CASP)

The SWI-Prolog port allows sCASP to call out to Prolog.  This is achieved
by declaring a predicate as `prolog`.  Prolog code may be executed in two
modes:

  - `justified` (default) <br>
    In this case the predicate is handled by a meta-interpreter that
	extends the sCASP justification tree.  The meta interpreter can
	deal with cuts, `(If->Then;Else)`, disjunctions, and `=>/2` rules.
  - `opaque` <br>
    Call as native Prolog goal.  On success only the called Prolog
	goal appears in the justification.

Some example declarations:

    :- prolog p/2.
	:- prolog (p/2, q/1) as opaque.

If the Prolog call appears in  a s(CASP) negation, the following takes
place:

  - If the Prolog call is ground, use Prolog `\+ Goal`.  This is a case
    of non-floundering negation and thus safe.
  - If the Prolog call is not ground, call findall/3 to find all solutions
    to the goal.  If there are none, the negation is true.  Otherwise,
	disequality constraints are created that prevent the variables to
	match a result.   The generated pattern of partial bindings and
	constraints is the same as s(CASP) calling `not Goal` where the
	predicate is defined as a set of facts.


# About s(CASP)

The `s(CASP)` system is a top-down interpreter for ASP programs with
constraints.

This work was presented at ICLP'18 ([Arias et al. 2018](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/theory-and-practice-of-logic-programming/article/constraint-answer-set-programming-without-grounding/55A678C618EF54487777F021D89B3FE7)), also available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11162).

And extended description of the justification trees was presented at ICLP'20 ([Arias et al. 2020](http://www.cliplab.org/papers/sCASP-ICLP2020/TC-explainCASP.pdf)).

## Introduction

`s(CASP)` by [Joaquin Arias](mailto:joaquin.arias@urjc.es), is based on
[`s(ASP)`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sasp-system/) by
Kyle Marple.

`s(CASP)` is an implementation of the stable model semantics of
constraint logic programming. Unlike similar systems, it does not
employ any form of grounding. This allows `s(CASP)` to execute programs
that are not finitely groundable, including those which make use of
lists and terms.

## Usage of s(CASP)

```

### Using the principal options

Let us consider the program `test.pl`:
```
p(A) :- not q(A).
q(A) :- not p(A).
?- p(A).
```

* To obtain the models one by one:

```
$ scasp test.pl
Answer 1	(in 0.09 ms):
p(A) ,  not q(A)

 ? ;
```
for this example there is only one model so when we ask for more models (introducing `;` after the `?`) the evaluation finishes.

* To obtain all the models automatically use the option `-sn` with `n=0`:

```
$ scasp -s0 test.pl
```

* To obtain a specific number of models, e.g., 5, invoke:

```
$ scasp -s5 test.pl
```

* To use scasp with its iterative mode invoke s(CASP) with `-i`, and introduce the query after `?-`:

```
$ scasp -i test.pl
?- q(A).
Answer 1	(in 0.228 ms):
q(A) ,  not p(A)
 ?
```

### Explanation and debugging

* To print the "translation" of the code (with duals predicates and
check-rules) use `--code`:

```
$ scasp --code test.pl
```

* To obtain the justification tree for each model use `--tree`.
```
$ scasp --tree test.pl
```

To generate the code/justification tree in English use `--human` and
to control which literals should appear check the instructions in the
following paper: ([Arias et al. 2020](http://www.cliplab.org/papers/sCASP-ICLP2020/TC-explainCASP.pdf)).

## Examples & Benchmarks & Event Calculus

### Examples

There are some examples, most of them available in the distribution of
s(ASP).  Check them [here](examples/) and in your local installation
(the default folder is `~/.ciao/sCASP`).

### Towers of Hanoi

`s(CASP)` vs `Clingo` _standard_ vs `Clingo` _incremental_.

See more details [here](examples/benchmark_iclp18/towers_hanoi/README.md).

### Stream data reasoning

Let us assume that we deal with series of data items, some of which
may be contradictory. Moreover, different sources may give data a
different degree of trustworthiness which can make some pieces of
inconsistent data to be preferred. Lets us assume that `p(A)` and `q(A)`
are contradictory and we receive, from source _S1_, `p(A)` and, from
source _S2_, `q(a)`. We may decide that: (i) `p(A)` is __true__ because _S1_ is
more realiable; (ii) or if _S2_ is more realiable, `q(a)` is __true__, and any
value `not a` (i.e., _X \= a_) `p(A)` is also __true__; (iii) or, if both
sources are equally reliable, them we have (at least) two different
models: one where `q(a)` is __true__ and another where `p(A)` is __true__ (also
for _X=a_).

See more details [here](examples/benchmark_iclp18/stream_data_reasoning/README.md).

### Traveling salesman

A variant of the traveling salesman problem (visiting every city in a
country only once, starting and ending in the same city, and moving
between cities using the existing connections) where, in addition, we
want to find out the length of the Hamiltonian cycle.

Solutions for this problem using `CLP(FD)` and `ASP` appear in
([Dovier et al. 2005](https://users.dimi.uniud.it/~agostino.dovier/PAPERS/DFP05-cilc.pdf)),
with comparable performance. However, they show that the `ASP`
encoding is more compact, even if the `CLP(FD)` version uses the
library predicate `circuit/1`, which does the bulk of the work and
whose code is non-trivial.

We will show that also in this problem, where the `ASP` solution is more
compact than that of `CLP(FD)`, `s(CASP) `is more expressive.

See more details [here](examples/benchmark_iclp18/traveling_salesman/README.md)


### Yale shooting scenario

Let us compare the expressiveness of `s(CASP)` vs `ASP` + constraints
using the spoiling Yale shooting scenario
([Janhunen et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.04053.pdf)).

In this scenario we have an unloaded gun and three possible actions
load, shoot, and wait. If we load the gun, it becomes loaded. If we
shoot the gun and it was loaded for no more than 35 minutes, the
turkey is killed. Otherwise, the gun powder is spoiled. We are looking
for an executable plan such that:
* the turkey is killed within 100 minutes,
* considering that we are not allowed to shoot in the first 35
minutes.

See more details [here](examples/benchmark_iclp18/yale_shooting_scenario/README.md)

## Event Calculus

Let us use s(CASP) to implement Event Calculus, a more complex
application, with several scenarios.

In this [folder](examples/benchmark_EventCalculus/lopstr19/) you will
find the benchmark and instruction to
reproduce the evaluation and example presented in the paper
__"Modelling and Reasoning in Event Calculus using Goal-Directed Constraint Answer Set Programming"__, presented in LOPSTR'19.
